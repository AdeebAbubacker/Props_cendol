In  component 'A'  there is a variable called cendol, this value of variable has been passed to component 'B' to display the value. And after that In B component there is a button on click of button the value of variable which has been got from A component should increment by 10.
                                                            
#Description      
                                                            
In this project we want to pass value from one component to other using the props concept ,The components are 'component A' and 'component B'.
                                                                                              
#Algorithm                                                                                                                                                          
1. First we save value of cendol variable to 2.                                                                 
2. Then we pass 2 values as props cendol and setCendol.                                                            
3. So setCendol is the function to update the cendol variable.                                                                     
4. So now, we can update cendol variable by 10.                                                                                              

#Hooks Used                                                                                                                                                                                                             
useState                                                 

#Functions                                                                                                                                                                          
Updatevalue() - To update value in "component B" by 10 on each increment.
